Are there forty-seven young man in your house? There are eighty-nine eggs in their kitchen. Are there eighty-nine eggs in their kiechen? There are one hundred and fifteen dogs in your garden. Are there one hundred and fifteen dogs in your garden?

# 二十五、动词have的用法与三大人称

## 1、I have a beatiful cat. (我有一只漂亮的猫)

1. there be，表示……地方有……。
2. have，它用来表示“拥有东西”。而这两个“有”的差别在于there be是静态的，而have却是动态的
3. 英文句子一定要有动词，而常用的动词am / are / is＝“是”的意思,而have这个动词，属于实义动词，是“拥有”的意思
4. 英文里一个句子只能有一个动词，因此is和have不能同时出现在同一句子里
5. 实义动词和be动词am / are / is一样，都要配合“你、我、他”而有不同的写法。所谓的“你、我、他”就是英文里的“人称”，其中“我”代表第一人称，“你”代表第二人称，而除此以外的就称为第三人称。
6. have会随着不同人称而有不同写法，当遇到第三人称的单数时，“have”必须改成“has”。刚提到我 / 你以外都算是第三人称，所以“他 / 她 / 它 / 这个老师 / 同学们 / 玛丽 / 医生们……”，都算是第三人称，由此可知第三人称包含了单数和复数名词，而只有在第三人称是单数时，“have”才改成“has”。
7. I have an old boat. There is an old boat in the garage. You have a new knife. There is a new knife under the desk. He has a red tie. There is a red tie on the chair. She has two beautiful watches. There are two beautiful watches in the kitchen. That boy have three ballons. There are three ballons above the house. This girl have four blue skirts. There are four blue skirts in the living room.

# 二十六、动词teach的用法、主格和宾格

## 1、 I teach him English.（我教他英文）

1. “teach”是动词，意思是“教学，“承受动作”的人称，和前面所学的第一至第三人称写法有所不同。承受动作的人称，称为“宾格
2. 主格＋teach ＋宾格＋英文［科目］
3. teach和上一课所学到的have一样，都会随着不同人称而有不同写法。当遇到第三人称单数时，“have”必须改成“has”，而“teach”则必须改成“teaches”。
4. “主格”就是主动做出动作的人，而“宾格”就是承受动作的人或东西
5. I you he she it we you they -> me you him her it us you them(主格->宾格)
6. I teach you English. You teach me English. He teaches him English. She teaches him math. She teaches her math. He teaches her math. I teach you history. They teach us history. We teach them history. Your teacher teaches us art. My mather teaches you art. Her sister teaches them art. your doctor teaches me music. Our teacher teaches them music. Their father teaches us music.

# 二十七、助动词Do和Does的用法

## 1、Do you teach him English?(你教他英文吗)

1. 一般疑问句只要将be动词am / are / is移到句首，就能形成疑问句了。但是实义动词（have / teach）的疑问句，并没有am / are / is，所以这时就需要助动词do来取代am / are / is帮忙形成疑问
2. do的功用：do帮助句子形成疑问句，称为“助动词”。遇到第三人称单数时，助动词do要改成does。
3. 使用助动词时，后面的动词要“打回原形”。（也就是第一人称所使用的动词）
4. Do I, Do you, Do we, Do you, Do they. Dose he, Dose she, Does it, Does my brother, Does your sister
5. I teach you English. Do I teach you English? You teach me English. Do you teach me English? He teaches him English. Does he teach him English? She teaches him math. Does she teach him math? She teaches her math. Does she teach her math? He teaches her math. Does he teach her math? I teach you history. They teach us history. Do they teach us history? We teach them history.

Does her sister teach them art? Your doctor teaches me music. Dose your doctor teach me music? Our teacher teaches them music. Does our teacher teach them music? Their father teaches us music. Does their father teach us music?

# 二十八、肯定回答的表达

## 1、Yes, I teach him English.(是的，我教他英文)

1. Do除了可当助动词之外，还可用来取代“所做的事情”，代表“是”的意思
2. 例如，Yes,I do. Yes, He does.
3. 遇到“主格”也就是“主动做出动作的人”是第三人称单数这种情况时，就要使用does
4. be动词的问句，才用be动词回答；实义动词的问句，要用助动词do回答。
5. I teach you English. Do I teach you English? Yes, you do. You teach me English. Do you teach me English? Yes, I do. He teaches her English. Does he teach her English? Yes, he does. She teaches him math. Does she teach him math? Yes, she does. They teach us history. Do they teach us history? Yes, they do. We teach them history. Do we teach them history? Yes, we do. You teach them history. Do you teach them history? Yes, we do.

# 二十九、 否定句don't/doesn't用法

## 1、No, I don't teach him English.(不，我没有教他英文)

1. 我“没有”＝我“不是”＝I“do not”
2. 当需要简单回答时，可以用do取代“所做的事情”，来代表“是”的意思，因此肯定回答时，我们只需要说“Yes, I do.”。而否定回答时，句中再加一个not，变成“No, I do not.”。另外若遇到“主格”也就是“主动做出动作的人”是第三人称单数时，就要使用does，变成“No, he does not.”。
3. do和not为了简便可以结合成一个词＝don’t，而does＋not就等于doesn’t
4. Do you have a dog? No, I don't. I don't have a dog. Does he have a pen? No, he doesn't. He doesn't have a pen. Does he teach us English? No, he doesn't. He doesn't teach us English. Does your father teach us math? No, he doesn't. He doesn't teach us English. Do they teach you art? No, they don't. They don't teach me art.

# 三十、形容词many/much的用法

## 1、I have many books.(我有许多书) He has much money.(他有许多钱)

1. 可数名词：有明确数量可以数（复数＋s / es），大多要保持外表完整，通常不可拿刀切开。 （ 猫、狗、苹果、巴士）
2. 一只猫＝a cat　　两只狗＝two dogs　　三辆公交车＝three buses
3. 不可数名词：没有明确数量可以数，后面不需要加s / es，通常外表较不具体，所以拿刀切开后，本质不变。（时间、水、钱）
4. 时间＝time　　　水＝water　　　钱＝money
5. many（形容词），是“许多的”的意思； many只能接复数可数名词
6. much（形容词），也是“许多的”的意思；much只能接不可数名词,
7. 不可数名词，不能用复数概念
8. I have many birds. There are many birds in the tree. He has many books. There are many books in my room. You have many chairs. There are many chairs under the tree. We have many monkeys. There are many monkeys in the zoo. You have many students. There are many students in the classroom. 
9. Time is money. He has much money. There is much money in my house. I drink much milk. There is much water in the pool. There is much beer in kitchen.

# 三十一、疑问词及连词When的用法

## 1、When do you teach him English?（你何时教他英文）

1. 当我们要问对方“什么时候”，就必须使用到“When”这个疑问词，而When的用法和前面所学的“What”“Why”相同，都必须放在句首形成疑问语气
2. When放在句首，且放在do/does之前形成疑问语气，句尾的语调要下降。
3. 改疑问句3步骤：1.先想肯定句 2.再改疑问句 3.再改成句首是when的疑问句
4. 之前我们学过“What”“Where”“Why”“How”这几个疑问词，当它们遇到疑问句中有实义动词时，都必须放在句首，且在do / does之前的位置形成疑问语气！
5. When does he teach me English? When do you teach her English? When does he teach us English? What do you have? What does he have? Where do you teach him? Where does he teach you? Why do you teach us English? Why do I teach them English? How does he teach me history? How do you teach her history? 

## 2、 When也可当连词，意思是当……时候；用法同because，可连接两个句子。

1. when当连词时，用法和“because”一样，除了可放在句首将两个句子连成一句，也可以放在句中当两节火车厢之间的挂钩。
2. 当“when”放在句首时＝“when＋句1＋，＋句2”，而当“when”放在句中时＝“句1＋when＋句2”。
3. 不过，要特别注意的是，当“when”放在句中时，“when”前面不用再加逗号。与because相反
4. When he is busy, he is angry. When that bird is in the tree, it is happy. When that monkey plays in my garden, it is happy. When Mr.Lee teaches Marry English, she is happy. He is angry when he is busy. That bird is happy when it is in the tree. The monkey is happy when it plays in my garden. Marry is happy when Mr.Lee teaches her English. 

# 三十二、疑问句How的其他用法

## 1、How many books do you have?(你有几本书)

1. How＋形容词 / 副词形成不同意思的问法
2. How＋old”＝“如何老”＝“多老”＝“几岁”，“How＋many”＝“如何＋许多”＝“多多”＝“多少”。另外“How”也可与副词结合成不同意思。例如，“How＋often”＝“如何＋常常”＝“多久一次”。
3. How many（多少）必须搭配复数可数名词，而How much（多少）必须搭配不可数名词。另外“How many”“How much”“How often”的用法都与“How”相同，必须放在 be动词am / are / is或助动词do / does之前，来形成疑问语气。
4. How many students are there in your school? There are ninety-three students in my school. How many students do you teach? I teach twienty-seven students. How many students does she teach? She teaches thirty-one students.

## 2、牛奶是不可数名词，不能用复数概念，所以要用is来形成疑问句；同时把there is改成is there。

1. How much beer is there in the car? I don't know. How much beer do you drink? I don't know. How much beer does he drink? I don't know. How much money do you have? I don't know. How much money does he have? I don't know because I am dunken.

## 3、How often用法与How相同，必须放在助动词do / does之前，来形成疑问语气

1. How often是问事情发生的频率，不是问次数或时间
2. How often do you teach them music? How often does your mother teach you? How often do you teach them math? How often does she teach us art? How often do they drink?

# 三十三、及物动词与不及物动词

## 1、Do you like this book?(你喜欢这本书吗) Yes, I like it.(是的，我喜欢)

1. 实义动词又可分成及物动词和不及物动词
2. 及物动词就是动词后面必须有人 / 物作为宾语来承受这个动作，如此句子的意思才比较完整。而不及物动词本身句子的意思较为完整，所以动词后面不用有人 / 物作为宾语来承受这个动作
3. “have”的后面习惯加上“对象”＝“I have a book.”，这样会比“Ihave.”的语意更加完整
4. “微笑＝smile”本身就可完整传达语意，后面不须特别加上“对象”来当宾语，所以“我微笑着。＝I smile.”就已经是完整的句子。
5. 大部分的动词都兼具“及物动词”和“不及物动词”两种特性，只有极少部分的动词才会只当“及物动词”使用。另外要注意的是，只有名词和代词才可以担任宾语！
6. “like”是“喜欢”的意思，“like”是极少数只能当“及物动词”的动词，也就是说，“like”的后面无论如何都要加上“宾语”来承受“like”这个动作，所以“我喜欢”必须写成“I like it.”才算是正确。
7. I like that blue bus. Do you like that blue bus? Yes, I do/ Yes, I like it. Why do you like that blue bus? I like that blue bus because it is beautiful. I like that garden. Do you like that garden?  Yes, I do/ Yes, I like it.  I like that garden because there are many flowers in that garden.

# 三十四、动词不定式的用法

## 1、 He likes to run in the park.(他喜欢在公园里跑步)

1. 动词不定式＝to＋动词原形（to后面的动词要“打回原形”）
2. 在英文句子里一定要有动词，而且一个句子只能有一个动词！如果这个句子必须有“两个动作”才能完整表达语意的话，那该怎么办呢？例如，“我喜欢跑步”这句里，有“喜欢”和“跑步”两个动作，这时就需要“to”来帮忙，将它放在“喜欢”和“跑步”这两个动词的中间，就可以解决句子中同时存在两个动词的状况，形成“动词1＋to＋动词2”的结构。而其中“to＋动词2”这样的写法，就称作“不定式”
3. “地点”通常要放在句尾。英文句子里，除了有表达过程的“动作”外，通常还要有动作发生时的地点。而英文习惯先“讲完动作”，再说出“地点”，因此地点通常会被放在句尾来叙述
4. I like to walk. I like to walk in that garden. He likes to run. He likes to run in the forest. She likes to swim. She likes to swim in the swimming pool. They like to play. They like to play in my school. John's father likes to teach us English. John's father like to teach us English in his living room. 

## 2、使用“连词and”，就可以允许两个动词同时存在一个句子中！

1. He likes to read and he likes to run. He likes to read and run.
2. He likes to walk and He likes to swim. He likes to walk and swim. I like to sing and I like to drive. I like to  sing and drive. You like to study and you like to work. You like to study and work. Thoes cats like to eat and those cats like to sleep. Those cat like to eat and sleep.

# 三十五、频率副词的用法

## 1、My father is always in his office.(我的父亲（是）总是在他的办公室)

1. 副词：一种“辅助说明”的词
2. 频率副词：跟“事情发生的频率”有关的副词
3. always（总是） often（常常） usually（经常） sometimes（有时） seldom（很少） never（从不）
4. “频率副词”的用法跟中文相似，通常会放在be动词am / are / is的后面，或是实义动词的前面
5. Her house is always dirty. Her piano is often dirty. This young person is usually weak. That postman is sometimes busy. Their parents are seldom merciful. Although that gentleman is rich, he is never lazy. They are usually sad because they are often sick. His daughter always plays in the room. Marry never smiles. My mother seldom drinks in the living room. That teacher usually draws in the office. Your father sometimes swims in the pool. He often teaches me English.

## 2、频率副词里面的usually（通常）和often（常常）两个词通常会混用，不过要细分出两者差异的话，usually（通常）比较常用于“习惯”的表示；而often（常常）比较常用于“次数”的表示，所以还是要根据句子的语意来选择合适的表达。

1. 强调整句时sometimes会放句首
2. That student is sometimes lazy. Sometimes that student is lazy. That teacher sometimes teaches us English. Sometimes that teacher teaches us English.

# 三十六、方式副词的构成方法和用法

## 1、That dog runs quickly.(那只狗跑的快)

1. 方式副词：大多放在动词后，用来辅助说明“动作状况”
2. 要形容一个人很高，就必须借助“形容词tall”来辅助说明这个人的身高状况。同样，要形容一个人跑得快慢，就要借助副词来辅助说明“跑步的状况”，否则无法了解这个人跑步快慢的状况。
3. “形容词”主要用来辅助说明“名词”，而“副词”则是用来辅助说明“动词”的 形容词...的，副词...地
4. 形容词：slow,quick,sad,beautiful. 副词：slowly, quickly, sadly, beautifully
5. Your sister runs quickly. Does your sister run qucikly? My brother walks slowly. Does my brother walk slowly? She sings sadly. Does she sing sadly? That girl dresses beautiful. Does that gir dress beautiful?

## 2、形容词词尾是”辅音+y“要去掉y改成ily

1. 形容词：happy, hungry, busy, angry. 副词：happily. hungrily busily angrily
2. That student learns happily. Does that student learn happily? That old man works hungrily. Does that old person works hungrily? That driver drives busily. Does that driver drive busily? That girl cries angrily. Does that girl cry angrily?

## 3、形容词和副词相同

1. 形容词：fast early late hard(困难的) 副词 fast fast early late hard （努力地）
2. That bird flies fast. Why does that bird fly fast? That farmer works early. Why does that fatmer work early? That boy arrives late. Why does that boy arrive late? Your friend works hard. Why does your friend work hard?

## 4、形容“好坏”的副词：辅助说明动作完成的状况

1. 形容词 good（好的） bad 副词 well(好地) badly
2. My sister sings well. Why does my sister sing well? That teacher teaches English well. Why does that teacher teach English well? That student draws badly. Why does that student draw badly?

# 三十七、地点副词及时间副词的用法

## 1、She works here today.(她今天在这里工作)

1. 地点副词：辅助说明“地点位置”在哪里。
2. 时间副词：辅助说明“时间”的状况。
3. 当“地点和时间”刚好都在同一句时，这时我们要先写地点，再写时间哦！
4. “地点副词”前面并不需要特别加上“in”或“at”等介词来协助说明地点位置。
5. here 在这里， there 在那里
6. She often comes here. Does she often come here? Why does she often comes here? She often comes here because She likes it. He always comes there. Does he always come there? Why does he always come there?  He always goes there because he doesn't  like to come here.(like的否定形式需要加助动词，like to 后面跟come表示动词不定式，需要用原come)

## 2、“时间副词”主要是用来辅助说明句子里的“时间状况”

1. today tonight now early late
2. We learn English today. Do we learn English today? When do we learn English today? We sing tonight. Do we sing tonight? When do we sing tonight?     He is weak now. Is he weak now? Why is he weak now? He comes early. Does he come early? Why does he come early? She comes late. Does she come late? Why does she come late?

## 3、  “地点”和“时间”若“同时存在”时，要先写地点，再写时间。

1. We sing here tonight. We learn English there tonight. She is here now. He comes there early. She comes here late.

# 三十八、程度副词的用法

## 1、She sings very well and she is very beautiful.(她唱的非常好而且她是非常漂亮的)

1. very是个特别的“程度副词”，只能用来修饰“形容词”和“副词”，像是very beautiful / very well，但不能用来修饰“动词，如very like就是个错误的写法，要特别注意！
2. He likes me very much 中文：他非常喜欢我。 英文：他喜欢我＋非常多
3. He sings very well. This piano is very well, but it is very old. My brother is very smart, but he is very selfish. That farmer is very stupid, but he is very nice. Although this dog is very small, it is very fast. That student is very samrt, beacuse he learns very quickly. I like this girl very much, because she is very cute. I like that bird very much, because it sings very well.

## 2、“also（也是）”的用法其实和“always（总是）”的用法相同，都习惯放在be动词am / are / is的后面，实义动词前面。另外also可以通用于肯定句和否定句，没有特殊的限制

1. 和“也是”意思相同的“程度副词”还有too和either两个词。too和either的用法均习惯放在句尾，但要特别注意的是，also可以通用于肯定句和否定句，而too只能用于肯定句，either却只能用于否定句。
2. My mother is also very angry. Is your mother also very angry? He also has a radio. Does he also have a radio? I also like to sing here. Do you also like to sing here? I also teach art there. Do you teach art there? My sister also doesn't like to watch TV. They also don't like to play in that park.

## 3、“about＝大约”的意思，一个是“only＝只有”的意思。

1. “about”经常与数字配合使用。
2. How many birds are there on my desk? There are about ten birds on your desk. How many watches do you have ? I have about seven watches. How many students are there in that school? There are abount three hundred and sixty students in that school. How many students do you teach? I teach about forty students there.

## 4、only的用法和always相同，都习惯放于be动词am / are / is后面，实义动词的前面。

1. There are only three person in the classroom today. There are only two child here now. I only have a  baseball. He only likes to swim in the ocean. That boy only wants that toy now.(第三人称单数动词要转单数形式)

# 三十九、常和动词搭配的介词to/with/for

## 1、Those children usually run to the forest.(那些孩子经常跑到森林)

1. 如“走到（向）……地方”或“跑到（向）……地方”。中文会使用“到”或“向”来指出方向性，而在英文里，就必须靠“to”这个介词来指出“动作的方向性”。
2. “to”可以解决一个句子同时存在两个动词的问题，被当做不定式之外，还可以跟名词搭配，变成具有“方向性”的介词喔！
3. 向＋……地方＝to＋目的地（名词）
4. 若遇到here / there这样的地点副词，因为本身就已经具备辅助说明“地点位置”的功能，因此就不需要介词to来协助
5. “去到……地方”＝go to……地方，如果没有特别说明用什么方式“去”时，就可以用“go”来表示“去”的意思。当遇到主语是第三人称单数时，go就要改成goes。
6. “go to……地方”，通常地方前面要加the，但除了here / there不用加the之外，还有几个特别的情况不用加the。例如，“回家＝go home”， home和here /there一样可以当地点副词，所以前面就不用加介词 to了。另外两个特别的状况是“上学＝go to school”“睡觉＝go to bed”
7. “来到……地方”＝come to……地方，没有特别说明用什么方式“来”时，就用come来表示“来”的意思。当遇到主语是第三人称单数时，记住come要改成comes。
8. Those dogs often run to the park. Why do those gods often run to the park? They often run to the park because they like it there. I usually go to the station. Why do you usually go to the station? I usually go to the station because my mother works there. That fat driver seldom comes to my restaurant. Why does that fat driver seldom go to your restaurant? That doctor often goes home late. My brother always goes to bed early. That student always  goes to school early.   

## 2、和某人做什么＝做什么＋和＋某人＝做什么with＋某人

1. 中文习惯说“我和谁做什么”，但英文却习惯说“做什么和谁”，因为英文习惯先把“要做的事情”讲完，再讲“和谁一起完成”，所以“我和他跑步”就会变成“我＋跑步＋和＋他”。
2. I often swim with him.  Why do you often swim with him? Because he swims very fast, I want to learn his skill. I seldom drink with him. Why do you seldom drink with him? I seldom drink with him because he always likes to sing loudly.

## 3、为了＝for

1. for是介词，意思是为了，有特定“为了某人做了什么事”的意思。另外要特别注意的是for后面承受动作的“人”必须使用宾格。
2. These flowers are for you. Are these flowers for me? Yes, they are. Why are these flowers for me? Because I like you. Is that English book for me? Yes, it is. Why is that English book for me? Because I don't want to teach you English.

# 四十、连词if的用法及have to的用法

## 1、If you want to speak English well, you have to study hard.(如果你想要说好英语，你必须努力学习)

1. 在英文里若要表示“如果……”，就需要if来帮忙。If是连词，意思是“如果，可以放在句首和句中，用来连接两个句子，让语意更完整
2. 常跟“如果”相互搭配句子的词组，也就是“have（has）＋to（必须）”，它的用法和不定式相同，to后面的动词要“打回原形
3. if的用法和because一样，像两节火车厢之间的挂钩，将两个句子连成一句。例如，“If＋句1＋句2”，或是“句1＋if＋句2”
4. Why does my sister speak English very badly? She speaks English very badly because she is very lazy. If your sister wants to speak English well, she has to study hard. I want to play with John  in the living room. If you want to play with John, you have to clean your bedroom now. Do you teach well? Yes, I teach very well. If you want to learn fast, you have to study hard.

# 四十一、形式主语it的用法

## 1、It is good to run  every day.(每天去跑步是好的)

1. it用来代替过长的主语;
2. 句子中同时存在两个动词is和run时，记得使用不定式概念＝to run
3. It is happy for me to go to school. “It（这件事）是快乐的对我来说去上学”；另外要注意的是，for意思是“为了”，有针对某一个人的意思，所以“对我来说”＝for me。第一个to是不定式，第二个to是介词。
4. It is good to learn hard every day. It is bad to drink every day. It is bad to smoke every day. It is happy for me to go to the book store every day. It is happy for your father to watch TV every day. It is happy for her to swim with John. If you want to lean well, it is very important to study hard every day. If you want to run quickly, it is very important to practice every day.

# 四十二、常跟时间搭配的介词at / on / in

## 1、She has to learn English at ten o'clock. (她必须在10点学习英文)

1. 中文的“几点钟”，英文要用“o’clock”表示，意思是“……点钟”，“……点钟”算是比较精确的时间，所以要搭配的时间介词是“at”，如“在10点钟”要写成“at ten o’clock”，因此at除了可以当“位置”的介词“在……地点”之外，还可以拿来当“精准时间”的介词＝“at……点钟”。
2. o’clock是副词，用来辅助说明“……点钟”的意思，写法和hundred是“一百的单位”一样，后面不用加s
3. 几点了？“什么时间是这个时间（it）”的意思，英文写法是“What time is it?
4. now是时间副词，不能当主语；除非想要强调整句语气才会和sometimes一样，可以选择放在句首写成“Now it is two o’clock.”，不然，对初学者来说，时间还是先习惯放在句尾比较不容易混淆。
5. What time is it? It is eight o'clock now. Is it eight o'clock now? Yes, it is eight o'clock now. Why are you very angry? I am angry because my clock is broken. I have an important examination at nine o'clock, so I have to eat quickly. I have to drive quickly if I want to arrive there at nine o'clock.

## 2、周一~周日

1. 周一～周日”算是专有名词，因此第一个字母要大写，前面不用加a或the；另外on除了可以当“位置”的介词“在……东西上”之外，还可以拿来当“指定日期”的介词“on……日期上”。所以，在周日＝“on Sunday”。要注意的是，on Sundays指的是“每个星期天”，而on Sunday指的是“这个星期天”。
2. When is Mary's birthday? Mary's birthday is on Saturday. I want to celebrate Mary's brithday on Saturady. It is very important for me to celebrate  Mary's birthday. If you want to celebrate Mary's birthday, you have to buy a cake. I want to buy a cake at the cake store on Friday. Where is that cake store?  That cake store is near the bookstore. Do you want to buy a cake with me on Friday? Although I have an important examination on Friday, I want to buy a cake with you.

## 3、1月~12月

1. “1月～12月”算是专有名词，因此第一个字母一定要大写，“月份”的前面不用加a或the。另外，一个月通常有几十天，所以在表示月份的时候，指的是“在一段时间以内”，因此要搭配时间介词“in”，如“在1月＝in January”；所以in除了可以当“位置”的介词“在……里面”之外，还可以当“在一段时间内”的介词“in一段时间”。
2. When do you go to Taiwan? I plan to go to Taiwan in October. There are many tourists in Taiwan in October. Why are there many tourists in Taiwan in October? Because it is very cool in Taiwan in October. Are there many americans in Taiwan in July? Yes, there are many americans  in Taiwan in July.

## 4、不需要搭配介词的时间副词

1. at用来搭配“精准时间”，on用来搭配“指定的日期”，in用来搭配“在一段时间内”；但还有一些辅助说明时间的“时间副词”是不需要搭配介词at / in / on的，now today tonight.
2. 这些时间副词本身就代表了特定的时间，所以不必像星期日，或是2月这些专有名词，必须在前面加个介词at / in / on来辅助说明时间的状况，因此如同地点副词here / there一般，前面不用加at / in。
3. 有些时间副词是由“形容词＋时间”所组成的，every day this morning ,因此前面当然不用加介词at / in / on来辅助说明时间的状况。
4. “today”和“tonight”除了可当时间副词，放在句尾表示时间状况之外，也可当不可数名词放在句首,当today作为“时间副词”时，写成“It is my birthday today.”,当today当“不可数名词”时，可以取代“It”，写成“Today is mybirthday.”。
5. I like to go to school every day. Do you like to go to school every day? No, I hate to go to school every day. Because that dog in the school always likes to bite me. If you want to swim with Mary, you have to finish this work this morning.

# 四十三、原级/比较级/最高级的用法

## 1、She is as tall as he, and she is taller than I.(她和他一样高，而且她比我高)

1. 原级的写法 as＋形容词 / 副词＋as某人＝像某人一样
2. 所谓“原级”，表示两者没有程度上的差别，因此所使用的形容词 / 副词不需要有特别的写法，如“我像他一样高”＝“我是一样高＋像他”，英文写法是“I amas tall＋as he.”。要特别注意的是，既然是拿两者来比较，当然彼此的地位应该要对等，因此主格的写法也要一致，所以后面的“他”和前面的“我”相同，也要用“主格”写法he，不能用宾格写法him！
3. She is as happy as I. Why is she as happy as you? She is as happy as I because we go to the zoo today. Why is your brother as sad as her sister? My brother is as sad as her sister because they have to learn English this morning. Do you learn English well? Yes, I learn English very well. I learn English as well as she.

## 2、比较级的写法 我比他高＝我较高＋比起他＝我较高＋than他

1. 所谓“比较级”，表示两者有程度上的差别，因此所使用的形容词 / 副词就需要有特别的写法，如“我比他高”＝“我是较高的＋比起他”，英文写法是“I am taller＋than he.”，其中的“tall（高）”，要写成“较高的”taller。另外要注意的是，既然是拿两者来比较，当然彼此的地位应该要对等，因此主格的写法也要一致，所以后面的“他”必须和前面的“我”相同，也要用“主格”写法he，不能用宾格写法him。
2.  单音节单词的比较级写法：直接＋er，taller, 词尾是e的单词比较级写法：直接＋r cuter， 词尾是辅音＋y的单词比较级写法：去y＋ier happier,两个音节及以上的单词比较级写法：前面＋more（更多的） more beautiful
3. Is he as smart as you? No, he is smarter than I. Although he is smarter than you, you work harder than he. Because I work harder than he, I am richer than he. Is your daughter more beautiful than his daugher? Yes, my daughter is more beautiful than his daughter. Are you happier than that doctor? Yes, I am happier than that doctor.

## 3、最高级的写法 我是班上最高的＝我是最高的＋在班上＝我是the tallest＋在班上

1. 所谓“最高级”，表示程度的差异是最大的，因此所使用的形容词 / 副词就要有“差异程度最高”的写法。例如，“我是班上最高的”＝“我是最高的＋在班上”，英文写法是“I am the tallest＋in the class.”，其中的“最高的”要加上the表示“特定最高的那个”，而“最高的”就要写成tallest，合起来就等于“thetallest”。因为是最高级的概念，所以不需要和别人比较，当然后面就不用加than了！
2. 单音节单词最高级的写法：直接＋est cleanest 两个音节及以上的单词最高级写法：前面＋most（最多的） most beautiful.
3. That fox runs the fastest in the forest. Why does that fox run the fastest in the forest? Because it runs faster than that tiger. This flower is the most beautiful in the forest. Why is this flower the most beautiful in the forest? Because this flower is as beautifu as you. That fatmer is the richest people in the town. Why is that farmer the richest peope in the town? Because that fatmer works as hard as I.

## 4、更多的more / 最多的most的用法

1. 形容词 many/much 比较急more 最高级 most. 副词 much 比较级 more 最高级 most

## 5、少数不规则 / 少数需重复词尾的写法 

1. 形容词 good bad 比较级 better worse 最高级 best worst. 副词 well badly 比较级 better worse 最高级 best worst. 形容词 hot big 比较级 hotter bigger 最高级 hottest biggest
2. This baseball plater is the best in the school. He is also the biggest student in the school. That teacher is the worst in the school. Do you like to swim more? I like to swim more than I like to run. I like to swim most.

# 四十四、现在进行时的用法

## 1、Is he working now?(他现在正在工作吗)？No, he is sleeping now.(不，他现在正在睡觉)

1. 到目前为止，前面所学到的动词，都只是“简单呈现当下所做的动作”，句子中的动词，并没有非常清楚地呈现动作进行的状态。因此前面所学的动词形态称为一般现在时。
2. 当强调动作正在进行时，就要使用现在进行时的写法。中文也会使用“正在”这个词，来表示动作“正在”进行，而中英文唯一的差别在于中文的动词不会受到不同状况的影响而改变，但英文的动词就必须改变。
3. be动词＋动词ing＝是＋正在……
4. 一般现在时 I eat cake. 现在进行时 I am eating cake
5. 动词ing主要用来表示动作正在进行的状态，前面还必须加上is / am / are（b动词），让它具有动作正在进行的特性，动词加上ing之后，只是用来“描述现在这时刻，某动作正在进行”，又称为“现在分词”，因此它的性质比较接近形容词 / 副词，所以真正的动词仍然只有一个，也就是is / am / are（be动词）。
6. “现在进行时”若要强调“此时”正在进行的状态，后面通常会用“now（现在）”，来表示时间状态。
7. 大部分动词 work 原型+ing 词尾e不发音 smile 去e+ing 词尾前发重音 hit 重复字尾 + ing
8. Where are you? I am in the park. I am working in the park. It is very important for me to walk every day. There are many peoples working in the park now. Do you want to come here? No, I am watching TV in the living room. I like to watch TV more than I like to work.
9. What are you doing now? I am writing. Why are you writing? Because I am doing my homework. 
10. Where is Bili? He is playing wtih his dog.Are they digging the dirt in the garden? No, they are plying in the forest. What are they playing? They are running. Who is faster? Bili runs faster than that fat dog. Do you run as fast as Bili? No, I run as slowly as that fat dog. What are you doing? I am running in the park.

# 四十五、现在完成时的用法

## 1、Is he washing his bicycle?(他正在洗他的自行车吗)No, he has washed his bicycle.(不，他已经洗完了他的自行车)

1. 动词ing主要用来表示动作正在进行的状态，如果动作已经完成，就必须使用现在完成时来表示动作已经完成的状态。中文也会使用“已经”来表示动作已经完成。
2. have / has＋过去分词（P.P.）＝已经＋完成……
3. 一般现在时，I eat cake. 现在完成时 I have eaten cake.
4. 动词加上ing之后，只是用来描述现在这时刻，某动作正在进行，又称为现在分词，而它的性质比较接近形容词 / 副词,动词加上ed之后，也只是用来描述在过去时刻，某动作已经完成，所以被称为过去分词，英文简称P.P.，而它的性质也是接近形容词 / 副词。
5. 过去分词的写法是“动词＋ed”，如open的过去分词＝opened。不过仍有一些是不规则的变化，如buy的过去分词＝bought
6. I am very hungry now. Do you want to eat an egg? I have eaten nine eggs. Do you want to eat some bread? I have eaten much bread. Do you want to drink some juice? I have drunk much juice. You have to sleep now because you have eaten many things.

## 2、现在完成时的疑问句：

1. 你已经完成……了吗？＝Have＋you ＋动词ed？
2. 之前学过疑问句写法，只要将be动词或助动词（do / does）放到句首就可以了，其实完成时的have / has也可当助动词，因此完成时的疑问句也只要将have / has移到句首就可以了。但是为了要保持问句里问对方“已经做了什么”的形态，后面的动词不能打回原形，必须维持过去分词的形态，这点和一般疑问句do / does（助动词）后面的动词必须打回原形有很大的差别，请特别注意
3. 完成时疑问句的回答，必须维持完成时的形态，如“Yes, I have drunk. （是的，我已经喝了。）”（简易回答＝Yes, I have.）、“No, I have not drunk.（不，我还没有喝。）”（简易回答＝No, I have not.）
4. Do you want to buy the newest novel? I have bought the newest novel. Have you read the novel? No, I have not. What are you doing now? I am washing my father's car. Have you finished your homework? Yes, I have finished my homework. I have not finished my homework because I am reading the novel.

## 3、“约翰已经去台北了”＝“约翰＋has＋gone＋to＋台北”，这句通常是指约翰“已经在台北了”。如果是约翰“已经去过台北”，而现在人不在台北，就必须说“约翰＋has＋been＋to＋台北”。been是is / am / are的过去分词，在这里可用been来取代gone，表示“去过”。

1. Have you ever been to Korea? No, I have not. What country have you been to? I have been to Tailand、Japan and Amrica. My brother has gone to Thailand today. He likes Thailand because there is much declicous seafood there. I plan to go England this month. Have you ever been to England? Yes, I have. I like England because England is a beautiful country.

# 四十六、现在完成进行时的用法

## 1、I have been working for three hours.(我已经持续工作3小时了)

1. 现在完成时表示已经完成了动作，而现在完成进行时则表示虽然已经做了这个动作，但动作还在持续进行中，而持续进行多久时间，通常会用for（介词）来表示。现在就来了解现在完成进行时的用法吧！
2. have / has＋been＋动词ing＝已经＋持续＋正在完成……
3. 现在进行时 I am eating it. 现在完成时 I have eaten it. 现在完成进行时 I have been eating it.
4. 现在完成进行时＝现在完成时＋现在进行时，因此必须把放在have / has后面的be动词，改成“过去分词＝been”，而后面的动词ing其动作仍然正在进行中。因此，我们可以把have / has看成是“已经”，把been看成是“持续”的意思，而动词ing就是动作正在进行的意思。
5. for这个介词，是“为了”的意思，但for也可以当作“经过了多久时间”。因此我们在现在完成进行时里，也常会使用到for这个介词，来表示经过多久时间。
6. Has he washed the car? No, he has not. He has been washing the car for two hours. Why has he been washing the car for two hours. He has been washing the car for two hours because that cat is very dirty. Is your daughter crying? Yes, she has been crying for forty minutes. Why has she been crying for forty minutes? Because she has not finished her homework.

## 2、现在完成进行时除了常搭配for来表示经过了多久时间之外，也常搭配since这个介词来表示从什么时候开始。例如，“从5点开始他就已经持续地在工作（He hasbeen working since five o’clock.）”，表示他从5点持续工作到现在还没有停止。

1. Has he finished his homework? No, he has not. He has been sleeping since three o'clock. He has been sleeping for four hours. Why has he been sleeping since three o'clock? Because he is very tired today. He has been waking for one hour this afternoon. Why has he been waking for one hour this aftenoon? Because his bicycle is broken.

# 四十七、一般过去时的用法

## 1、 He played in the park yesterday.(他昨天在那个公园玩)

1. 在英文里过去所发生的动作，必须和现在所发生的动作做区别，这一点和中文非常,不同，而这种特殊的写法称为“动词过去式”。既然是过去所发生的动作，句子当然也要搭配“过去的时间”喔！
2. 一般过去时＝动词过去式＋过去时间
3. 一般过去时和一般现在时的用法其实是一样的，只是时间和动词，要改变成“过去时间”和动词过去式的写法，其余和一般现在时用法都一样。因此只要注意到“过去时间”和动词过去式的写法，很快就能学会。
4. 动词过去式和过去分词的写法大多相同，大部分都是“动词＋ed”，如open的过去分词和动词过去式都是open＋ed＝opened。不过仍有少数动词过去式是不规则变化的
5. be 动词过去式 am is are was was were 助动词过去式 do does did did
6. 动词过去式虽然和过去分词写法大多相同，但是过去分词只用来描述“在过去时刻，动作已经完成”，它的性质接近形容词 / 副词；而动词过去式却是真正的动词，两者不可混淆
7. 助动词“Does”要改成过去式“Did”，而助动词“Did”后面的动词，一样要打回原形＝run。
8. I was a doctor before. Were you a doctor before? Yes, I was a doctor before. Because I like to teach English, I am an English teacher now. When did you teach English in this city? I started to teach English in this town last year. Where did you teach English before? I taught English in Taipei two years ago. Taipei is also a beautiful city.

# 四十八、过去进行时的用法

## 1、He was sleeping at three o'clock yesterday afternoon.(昨天下午3点他正在睡觉)

1. “yesterday afternoon”是“昨天下午”的意思，属于“时间副词”。因此“在过去时间里正在进行的动作”，就必须使用“过去进行时”的写法。要特别注意的是，当句子里面同时存在“小时间”和“大时间”时，要先写“小时间”，再写“大时间”。
2. 过去进行时＝was / were＋动词ing＋过去时间
3. 过去进行时用来表示过去时间里，动作正在进行的状态，所以它的用法和现在进行时一样，差别只在于把am / are / is改成过去式的be动词＝was / were，再加上过去时间，如此就完成过去进行时的写法了。
4. 时间副词本身就代表了特定的时间，所以不需要加介词at / in / on来辅助说明时间的状况，如同地点副词here / there，前面不用加at / in。
5. 现在进行时 I am sleeping. 一般过去时 I slept. 过去进行时 I was sleeping
6. What were you doing at nine o'clock yesteday morning? I was swimming in the sea at nine o'clock yesterday morning. How many peoples  were there in the sea yesterday morning? There are about twenty-five peoples in the sea yesterday morning. When I was swimming yesterday, what were you doing? When you were swimming, I was doing my homework. What was he doing at five o'clock yesterday aftenoon? He was watching TV in the living room at five o'clock yesterday afternoon.

# 四十九、过去完成时的用法

## 1、Has he washed the car?(他已经洗完车子了吗)Yes, he had washed the car yesterday.(是的，他昨天已经洗完车子了)

1. had ＋动词ed＋过去时间＝过去已经＋完成……
2. 已经很重要
3. 现在完成时＝have / has＋动词ed， 动词加上ed之后，被称为过去分词，性质算是形容词 / 副词；而过去完成时只需要将have / has改成 had，并配合过去时间就完成了！
4. 一般过去时 I hidden it. 现在完成时 I have hidden it. 过去完成时 I had hidden it.
5. arrive”＝“抵达”的意思，通常“抵达大的地方”是“国家 / 城市”会用in这个介词，写成“arrive＋in＋国家 / 城市”，若“抵达小的地方”是“公园 / 车站”会用at这个介词，写成“arrive＋at＋公园 / 车站”
6. had Mary gone to Japan yesterday? Yes, she had gone to Japan yesterday. When did she arrive in Japan? She arrived in Japan at two o'clock. Had Billy also arrived in Japan yesterday? Yes, Billy had arrived in Japan yesterday morning. Had You called them this morning? Yes, I had called them at eleven o'clock this morning. Had they finished their work this morning? When I called them, they had finished their work.

## 2、before除了可以当时间副词“以前”之外，“before”也可以当连词。而before的用法和when相同，都可放在句首 / 句中连接前后两个句子。

1. Before you arrived here, your mother had been sick. When was she sick? Your mother had been sick since six days ago. Did she drink any water? Yes, she had drunk some water, before you arrived here.  Do you want to eat some bread? No, I am not hungry now. Before I came there. I had eaten many things. 

# 五十、过去完成进行时的用法

## 1、When you arrived here yesterday, I had been sleeping for three hours.(昨天当你抵达这里时，我已经持续睡了3小时)

1. 过去完成进行时的重点不在于动作是否已经完成，而是在强调当时正在做什么,
2. had＋been＋动词ing＋过去时间＝已经＋持续＋正在完成……＋在当时
3. for这个介词，除了当“为了”，也可以当“经过了多久时间”。因此在过去完成进行时里，也常使用到for这个介词，以表示经过多久时间。
4. Did you run in the park yesteday afternoon? Yes,  I was running when you sew me yesterday afternoon. Before you sew me, I had been running for forty-five minutes. Did you also run in the park yesterday afternoon? No, I waited for my mother at the park yesterday afternoon. Before I sew you, I had been waiting for my mother for two hours.

## 2、过去完成进行时除了常搭配“for”来表示“经过了多久时间”，也常搭配“since”这个介词来表示“自从什么时候开始

1. What are you doing now? I am studying history now. How long have you studied history? Before you called me, I had been studying history since two o'clock in the afternoon. Do you want to go to the zoo with me? I don't want to go to the zoo today, because  today is a rainy day. Before you called me, it had been rainning for seven o'clock since eight o'clock in the morning. I don't like rainy days, and the animals  in the zoo don't like rainy days either.

# 五十一、一般将来时的用法

## 1、It will rain tomorrow.(明天将会下雨)

1. 一般将来时＝will＋动词原形
2. “will”意思是“将要”，没有了“will”，就无法表达一般将来时中“将要做什么”的意思。另外要注意，“will”是用来帮助形成一般将来时的语句，算是“助动词”的一种，和“do / does”被当作“助动词”时的用法一样，必须将后面的动词“打回原形”。
3. 一般现在时 she likes you 一般过去时 she liked you 一般将来时 she will like you.
4. 一般将来时“will”的疑问句和一般现在时疑问句的助动词“do / does”的用法相同，只要将will放在句首，就可形成疑问句了，但是要记得将“will”后面的动词保持“动词原形”。至于“will”的否定句，也是跟助动词“do / does”的用法一样，在后面加上not，变成will not，就可形成否定句的形态
5. 一般将来时讲的是以后的事，所以也常会搭配未来的时间点一起出现
6. What are you doing now? I am planning to visit my old friend. When will you visit your old friend? I will visit my old friend the day after tomorrow. Where does your friend live? My friend lives in Beijing. How many days will you stay there? I will stay in Beijing for one week. Have you ever been to Beijing? No, I have not been to Beijing. I will go to Beijing with Billy this year. Billy like Beijing very much, because there are many beautiful buildings in Beijing.

# 五十二、将来进行时的用法

## 1、John will be swimming at eight o'clock tomorrow morning.(约翰明天早上8点那时将正在游泳)

1. 将来进行时就是“将来那时将正在进行的动作”，英文写成“will＋be＋动作ing”。其中“be”是am / are / is因为will（助动词）的关系而被“打回原形”的写法。另外要注意的是，当句子里面同时存在“小时间”和“大时间”时，要先写“小时间”，再写“大时间”。
2. 将来进行时＝will＋be＋动作ing
3. 之前学到“现在进行时＝am / are / is＋动作ing”以及“过去进行时＝was /were＋动作ing”的写法，现在来认识“将来进行时＝will＋be＋动作ing”的写法。其中的“be”，是am / are / is被will（助动词）“打回原形”的写法，也因此am / are / is才会被归类成“be动词”。要特别注意的是，初学者常会忘了写上打回原形的“be”喔！
4. 一般将来时 I will watch TV, 现在进行时 I am watching TV, 将来进行时 I will be watching TV.
5. Will you go to the museum with me at ten o'clock tomorrow morning ? No, I will not go to the museum with you at ten o'clock tomorrow morning . Because I will be washing my car at ten o'clock tomorrow morning . Will you go to the bookstore wiht me at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon? No, I will not go to the bookstore wiht you at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon. Because I will be visiting my uncle at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon. Will you be home tomorrow evening. Yes, I will be home tomorrow evening. Will you walk with me in the park at seven o'clock tomorrow evening? No, I will not walk with you in the park at seven o'clock tomorrow evening. Because I will be learning English at seven o'clock tomorrow evening.

# 五十三、将来完成时的用法

## 1、She will have finished her work by two o'clock this afternoon.(今天下午2点之前，她将完成她的工作)

1. 将来完成时＝will＋have＋动词ed
2. 将来完成时＝will＋have＋动词ed，这里的“动词ed”， 被称为过去分词，性质算是形容词 / 副词，所以不会有句子同时存在两个动词的情况。另外要注意，will后面的“已经”要记得打回原形have。
3. 现在完成时 I have eaten it 一般将来时 I will eat it. 将来完成时 I will have eaten it.
4. “在几点之前”通常会用介词“by”来表示，所以“在2点之前”我们可以写成“by two o’clock”。因此“by”可以当作表示“时间状况”的介词＝“在……几点之前”的意思。另外，之前学过“before＝以前”，但其实“before”也可以用来表示“在几点以前”，因此“在2点之前”可以写成“before two o’clock”。
5. “by”指的是“截止到什么期限以前”，所以“by two o’clock”指的是“2点以前”，且包含“2点”。而“before two o’clock”指的是“2点以前”但是不包含“2点”这个时间。
6. before可以作时间副词，意思是“以前”，如“我以前见过她”＝“I saw her before.”。此外before也可以作介词＝“在几点以前”，如“9点之前我将会上床睡觉”＝“I will go to bed before nine o’clock.”。before也可以当连词＝“在……事件之前”，可放在句中 / 句首连接前后两个句子，如“他已经睡了，在你来这之前”＝“He had slept before you came here.”，或写成“Before you came here, he had slept.”
7. Have you finished your work? No, I have not finished my work. When will you have finished your work? I will have finished my homework by five o'clock. Are you sure? Yes, I am sure. Have you cleaned your bedroom? No, I have not cleaned my bedroom. When will you have cleaned your bedroom? I will have cleaned my bedroom before my husband come home.

# 五十四，将来完成进行时的用法

## 1、 I  will have been waiting for you for three hours by five o'clock.(在5点之前，我将已经持续等你3小时了)

1. ，将来完成进行时与将来完成时在概念上没有太大不同，两者都是用来表示“未来已经完成”的状态。唯一的差别在于将来完成进行时特别强调事情“持续进行”的状态，而将来完成时只简单叙述事情“将要完成”的状态。例如，“在5点之前，我将已经持续等你3小时了”，可以看出整句在强调在5点之前，已经“持续等待多久”的状况
2. 将来完成进行时＝will＋have＋been＋动词ing
3. 将来完成进行时句子必须加入“will（将要）”，并放在have（已经）been（持续）前面＝will＋have＋been，然后再加上动词ing（动作持续进行），变成will＋have＋been＋动词ing，用来表示未来持续进行并将完成的动作。
4. 一般将来时 I will wait for 1 hour. 现在完成时 I have waited for 1 hour. 将来完成进行时 I will have been waiting for 1 hour.
5. How long have you driven? I will have been driving for four hours by eight o'clock.  How long has my son slept? He will have been sleeping for three hours by eight o'clock. Where are you now?  We are on the freeway, because we will go to Beijing to visit Anne. How long has Anne lived in Beijing. She will has been living in Beijing for ten years next month. Is she waiting for you now? Yes, she is waiting for us now. When we arrive at her house, she will have been waiting for us for three hours.

# 五十五、常用情态动词can/ may/ must

## 1、Although I am sick today, I can go to school.(虽然我今天生病了，但我可以上学)

1. ，如“do / does”用来帮助形成疑问句或是否定句，而“have / has”用来帮助形成完成时中“已经”的概念，还有“will”则用来帮助形成将来时中“将要”的概念
2. 可以/能够 can 可以/能够 may 必须/一定要 must.
3. 用助动词：后面的动词一样要“打回原形”喔！
4. you can play baseball(你会打棒球，真厉害). You may play baseball. You must play baseball.
5. have to意思是“必须”。在语意和用法上，have to和must一样。must是助动词，而have to是不定式，所以两者后面都要加上动词原形。
6. 有些助动词习惯用“缩写”来表示，以节省书写时间，如“do＋not＝don’t”，“does＋not＝doesn’t”，“have＋not＝haven’t”，“has＋not＝hasn’t”。当“can”要表示否定语气时，也常缩写成“can＋not＝can’t”，意思是“不能够 / 不可以”。另外要注意的是，can / can’t的疑问句和do的疑问句写法一样，都要放在句首形成疑问，但若是有why的疑问句，则是要放在why的后面形成疑问。
7. Can I go to the libarary with John? No, you can't go to the libarary with John. Why can't I  go to the libarary. Because you have not cleaned the living room. Before you go to the libarary, you must clean the living room. May I ask you a qustion? Yes, you may. Do you like my new radio? Yes, I like it very much. If you allow me yo go to the libarary with John now, I can lend you that new radio. If you can go home by six o'clock, I can accept your request.

# 五十六、与现在事实相反的虚拟语气

## 1、If I had a computer. I would be very happy.(如果我有一台计算机，我将会非常开心)

1. 虚拟语气：必须使用动词和助动词的过去式来表示“假设”
2. “虚拟语气”必须使用动词 / 助动词的过去式来表示“虚拟”。但要注意的是，在虚拟语气里，be动词不论是第几人称，都只能用were，不能使用was。
3. can could may might will would shall(限定I/we使用) should
4. 用一般将来时，在语法上，第一人称“I”和“We”都必须使用“shall”来表示“将要……”的意思；但在习惯上，第一、第二、第三人称都可以用“will”来表示“将要……”的意思。
5. ① buy＋某人（宾格）＋东西 ② buy＋东西＋for＋某人（宾格）“买东西给某人
6. Why are you very sad? Because my birthday gift is not a bicycle. If my birthday gift were a bicycle, I would be very happy. If I had much money, I should buy a bicycle. If I were your father, I should buy a bicycle for you. Do you see my dog? No, I don't. Why are you looking for it. Because it is sick. If I saw it, I would tell you.

# 五十七、被动语态

## 1、This computer is made in America.(这台电脑是被美国制造的)

1. 被动语态＝am / are / is＋过去分词
2. 如“我买那辆车”，就是我“主动”做出“买车的动作”；至于“那辆车被我买下”，即“那辆车”是“被动”的让我给买下
3. 之前学过虚拟语气必须使用动词 / 助动词的过去式来表示，而这一课所学的被动语态却要使用“am / are / is＋过去分词”来表示。虽然大部分动词的过去式和过去分词写法一样，但仍有一些动词的过去式和过去分词写法是不同的
4. 被动语态后面通常会加上“地点”或“人”来表示“在什么地方被完成”，或是“被什么人给完成”。当被动语态后面所加上的是“人”时，通常会用“by”这个介词，写成“by＋某人（宾格）”表示“被……人完成”的意思。“by”的用法，之前学过可以作“时间介词”，是“在几点以前”的意思，现在又可以作“被……人完成”的意思
5. Is this computer your birthday gift? Yes, it is my birthday gift. Is It made in Korea? No, it is made in China. Where is your computer? My computer is stolen. When is your computer stolen?  My computer had been stolen in the library  this morning. If I were you, I would tell our teacher. I have told our teacher. I will be punished by my father because that computer is his birthday gift. If I were your father, I should forgive you.

# 五十八、关系代词的用法

## 1、He is the teacher who taught me English before.(他就是以前教我英文的那个老师)

1. 关系代词：who / which / that 功能：兼具“代词”与“连词”的功能
2. who和which都属于疑问词，目的在于形成疑问句。其实who和which也可以用来代表“要说明的人或物”，而这种用法是为了在名词后面，透过who / which延续句子来补充描述。例如，我们可以把“他就是教我英文的那个老师”分解成“他就是那个老师”＋“那个老师教我英文”。为了要把两句合成一句，所以使用“who”来代表“老师”，并延伸描述老师的状态，因此who又被称为关系代词
3. 关系代词用来代表“人”时，必须使用“who”，而用来代表“东西 / 动物”时，则要使用“which”。不过还有更简便的方式，就是使用“that”来代表“人 / 东西 / 动物”！
4. 如果关系代词要代替的是“承受动作”的“人”，我们就得使用“宾格”＝whom。另外“that”可以通用在“主格 / 宾格”的状况，所以“that”也可以用来代替宾格的whom。②如果关系代词必须表达“所有格”的意思时，我们就得使用“所有格”＝whose
5. Whose book is this? This book is mine. It is the book which is very expensive. Is the book very good? Yes, it is very good. My friend should also like this book. Who is your friend? My friend is that girl who teaches me English. Is her name Anne? Yes, She is that girl whose name is Anne.

# 五十九、动名词的用法

## 1、I like swimming.(我喜欢游泳)

1. 动名词可以理解成“动词转化成名词”的过程，跟现在分词一样，都是在动词的尾巴加上ing。阅读这件事＝reading、睡觉这件事＝sleeping、跑步这件事＝running。
2. 现在分词：I am swimming.＝我＋是＋正在游泳的（属于形容词的用法） 动名词：I like swimming.＝我＋喜欢＋游泳这件事（属于动名词的用法）
3. I like running. I am running. She likes swimming. She is swimming. He like sleeping in the classroom. He is sleeping in the classroom. My uncle likes fishing. My uncle is fishing.

## 2、动名词强调“事情本身”，没有限定在何时；不定式比较倾向“未来想要做的事情”。

1. 不定式：当一个句子必须有两个动词才能完整表达语意时，就需要“to”来帮忙形成不定式，以解决一个句子不能同时存在两个动词的问题。例如，“我喜欢游泳”这句话，要解决一个句子同时存在“喜欢”和“游泳”两个动词的情况，就必须在“游泳”的前面加上“to”，以形成不定式的状态，所以英文要写成“I like to swim.”
2. 动名词：当以动名词的方式来表达“我喜欢游泳”时，英文的写法为“我喜欢游泳这件事”＝I like swimming.
3. He likes running. He likes to run. She likes cooking. She likes to cook. Your father likes smoking. Your father like to smoke.
4. 若要说动名词和不定式的差异，大概只是两者在“语意上”有稍微的不同。动名词比较强调“事情本身”，没有限定在何时。例如，swimming＝游泳这件事；不定式比较倾向是“未来想要做的事情”，如to swim＝去游泳这件事。一般来若不特别强调“时间”，两者的语意是可以互通的，写法也是可以互换的。

## 3、前面提到动名词和不定式都可当作代词it来使用，因此它们跟it一样，都可以放在句首当做主语。

1. 只有名词才适合当主语，fish可当名词（鱼类），也可当动词（钓鱼）；而使用动名词fishing“钓鱼这件事”，或不定式to fish“去钓鱼这件事”，显然都比使用fish（鱼类）合理。
2. Swimming is a good exercise. To swim is a good exercise. Singing is fun. To sing is fun. Walking is boring. To walk is boring. Smoking is not a good habit. To smoke is not a good habit.
