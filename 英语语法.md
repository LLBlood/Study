Are there forty-seven young man in your house? There are eighty-nine eggs in their kitchen. Are there eighty-nine eggs in their kiechen? There are one hundred and fifteen dogs in your garden. Are there one hundred and fifteen dogs in your garden?

# 二十五、动词have的用法与三大人称

## 1、I have a beatiful cat. (我有一只漂亮的猫)

1. there be，表示……地方有……。
2. have，它用来表示“拥有东西”。而这两个“有”的差别在于there be是静态的，而have却是动态的
3. 英文句子一定要有动词，而常用的动词am / are / is＝“是”的意思,而have这个动词，属于实义动词，是“拥有”的意思
4. 英文里一个句子只能有一个动词，因此is和have不能同时出现在同一句子里
5. 实义动词和be动词am / are / is一样，都要配合“你、我、他”而有不同的写法。所谓的“你、我、他”就是英文里的“人称”，其中“我”代表第一人称，“你”代表第二人称，而除此以外的就称为第三人称。
6. have会随着不同人称而有不同写法，当遇到第三人称的单数时，“have”必须改成“has”。刚提到我 / 你以外都算是第三人称，所以“他 / 她 / 它 / 这个老师 / 同学们 / 玛丽 / 医生们……”，都算是第三人称，由此可知第三人称包含了单数和复数名词，而只有在第三人称是单数时，“have”才改成“has”。
7. I have an old boat. There is an old boat in the garage. You have a new knife. There is a new knife under the desk. He has a red tie. There is a red tie on the chair. She has two beautiful watches. There are two beautiful watches in the kitchen. That boy have three ballons. There are three ballons above the house. This girl have four blue skirts. There are four blue skirts in the living room.

# 二十六、动词teach的用法、主格和宾格

## 1、 I teach him English.（我教他英文）

1. “teach”是动词，意思是“教学，“承受动作”的人称，和前面所学的第一至第三人称写法有所不同。承受动作的人称，称为“宾格
2. 主格＋teach ＋宾格＋英文［科目］
3. teach和上一课所学到的have一样，都会随着不同人称而有不同写法。当遇到第三人称单数时，“have”必须改成“has”，而“teach”则必须改成“teaches”。
4. “主格”就是主动做出动作的人，而“宾格”就是承受动作的人或东西
5. I you he she it we you they -> me you him her it us you them(主格->宾格)
6. I teach you English. You teach me English. He teaches him English. She teaches him math. She teaches her math. He teaches her math. I teach you history. They teach us history. We teach them history. Your teacher teaches us art. My mather teaches you art. Her sister teaches them art. your doctor teaches me music. Our teacher teaches them music. Their father teaches us music.

# 二十七、助动词Do和Does的用法

## 1、Do you teach him English?(你教他英文吗)

1. 一般疑问句只要将be动词am / are / is移到句首，就能形成疑问句了。但是实义动词（have / teach）的疑问句，并没有am / are / is，所以这时就需要助动词do来取代am / are / is帮忙形成疑问
2. do的功用：do帮助句子形成疑问句，称为“助动词”。遇到第三人称单数时，助动词do要改成does。
3. 使用助动词时，后面的动词要“打回原形”。（也就是第一人称所使用的动词）
4. Do I, Do you, Do we, Do you, Do they. Dose he, Dose she, Does it, Does my brother, Does your sister
5. I teach you English. Do I teach you English? You teach me English. Do you teach me English? He teaches him English. Does he teach him English? She teaches him math. Does she teach him math? She teaches her math. Does she teach her math? He teaches her math. Does he teach her math? I teach you history. They teach us history. Do they teach us history? We teach them history.

Does her sister teach them art? Your doctor teaches me music. Dose your doctor teach me music? Our teacher teaches them music. Does our teacher teach them music? Their father teaches us music. Does their father teach us music?

# 二十八、肯定回答的表达

## 1、Yes, I teach him English.(是的，我教他英文)

1. Do除了可当助动词之外，还可用来取代“所做的事情”，代表“是”的意思
2. 例如，Yes,I do. Yes, He does.
3. 遇到“主格”也就是“主动做出动作的人”是第三人称单数这种情况时，就要使用does
4. be动词的问句，才用be动词回答；实义动词的问句，要用助动词do回答。
5. I teach you English. Do I teach you English? Yes, you do. You teach me English. Do you teach me English? Yes, I do. He teaches her English. Does he teach her English? Yes, he does. She teaches him math. Does she teach him math? Yes, she does. They teach us history. Do they teach us history? Yes, they do. We teach them history. Do we teach them history? Yes, we do. You teach them history. Do you teach them history? Yes, we do.

# 二十九、 否定句don't/doesn't用法

## 1、No, I don't teach him English.(不，我没有教他英文)

1. 我“没有”＝我“不是”＝I“do not”
2. 当需要简单回答时，可以用do取代“所做的事情”，来代表“是”的意思，因此肯定回答时，我们只需要说“Yes, I do.”。而否定回答时，句中再加一个not，变成“No, I do not.”。另外若遇到“主格”也就是“主动做出动作的人”是第三人称单数时，就要使用does，变成“No, he does not.”。
3. do和not为了简便可以结合成一个词＝don’t，而does＋not就等于doesn’t
4. Do you have a dog? No, I don't. I don't have a dog. Does he have a pen? No, he doesn't. He doesn't have a pen. Does he teach us English? No, he doesn't. He doesn't teach us English. Does your father teach us math? No, he doesn't. He doesn't teach us English. Do they teach you art? No, they don't. They don't teach me art.

# 三十、形容词many/much的用法

## 1、I have many books.(我有许多书) He has much money.(他有许多钱)

1. 可数名词：有明确数量可以数（复数＋s / es），大多要保持外表完整，通常不可拿刀切开。 （ 猫、狗、苹果、巴士）
2. 一只猫＝a cat　　两只狗＝two dogs　　三辆公交车＝three buses
3. 不可数名词：没有明确数量可以数，后面不需要加s / es，通常外表较不具体，所以拿刀切开后，本质不变。（时间、水、钱）
4. 时间＝time　　　水＝water　　　钱＝money
5. many（形容词），是“许多的”的意思； many只能接复数可数名词
6. much（形容词），也是“许多的”的意思；much只能接不可数名词,
7. 不可数名词，不能用复数概念
8. I have many birds. There are many birds in the tree. He has many books. There are many books in my room. You have many chairs. There are many chairs under the tree. We have many monkeys. There are many monkeys in the zoo. You have many students. There are many students in the classroom. 
9. Time is money. He has much money. There is much money in my house. I drink much milk. There is much water in the pool. There is much beer in kitchen.

# 三十一、疑问词及连词When的用法

## 1、When do you teach him English?（你何时教他英文）

1. 当我们要问对方“什么时候”，就必须使用到“When”这个疑问词，而When的用法和前面所学的“What”“Why”相同，都必须放在句首形成疑问语气
2. When放在句首，且放在do/does之前形成疑问语气，句尾的语调要下降。
3. 改疑问句3步骤：1.先想肯定句 2.再改疑问句 3.再改成句首是when的疑问句
4. 之前我们学过“What”“Where”“Why”“How”这几个疑问词，当它们遇到疑问句中有实义动词时，都必须放在句首，且在do / does之前的位置形成疑问语气！
5. When does he teach me English? When do you teach her English? When does he teach us English? What do you have? What does he have? Where do you teach him? Where does he teach you? Why do you teach us English? Why do I teach them English? How does he teach me history? How do you teach her history? 

## 2、 When也可当连词，意思是当……时候；用法同because，可连接两个句子。

1. when当连词时，用法和“because”一样，除了可放在句首将两个句子连成一句，也可以放在句中当两节火车厢之间的挂钩。
2. 当“when”放在句首时＝“when＋句1＋，＋句2”，而当“when”放在句中时＝“句1＋when＋句2”。
3. 不过，要特别注意的是，当“when”放在句中时，“when”前面不用再加逗号。与because相反
4. When he is busy, he is angry. When that bird is in the tree, it is happy. When that monkey plays in my garden, it is happy. When Mr.Lee teaches Marry English, she is happy. He is angry when he is busy. That bird is happy when it is in the tree. The monkey is happy when it plays in my garden. Marry is happy when Mr.Lee teaches her English. 

# 三十二、疑问句How的其他用法

## 1、How many books do you have?(你有几本书)

1. How＋形容词 / 副词形成不同意思的问法
2. How＋old”＝“如何老”＝“多老”＝“几岁”，“How＋many”＝“如何＋许多”＝“多多”＝“多少”。另外“How”也可与副词结合成不同意思。例如，“How＋often”＝“如何＋常常”＝“多久一次”。
3. How many（多少）必须搭配复数可数名词，而How much（多少）必须搭配不可数名词。另外“How many”“How much”“How often”的用法都与“How”相同，必须放在 be动词am / are / is或助动词do / does之前，来形成疑问语气。
4. How many students are there in your school? There are ninety-three students in my school. How many students do you teach? I teach twienty-seven students. How many students does she teach? She teaches thirty-one students.

## 2、牛奶是不可数名词，不能用复数概念，所以要用is来形成疑问句；同时把there is改成is there。

1. How much beer is there in the car? I don't know. How much beer do you drink? I don't know. How much beer does he drink? I don't know. How much money do you have? I don't know. How much money does he have? I don't know because I am dunken.

## 3、How often用法与How相同，必须放在助动词do / does之前，来形成疑问语气

1. How often是问事情发生的频率，不是问次数或时间
2. How often do you teach them music? How often does your mother teach you? How often do you teach them math? How often does she teach us art? How often do they drink?

# 三十三、及物动词与不及物动词

## 1、Do you like this book?(你喜欢这本书吗) Yes, I like it.(是的，我喜欢)

1. 实义动词又可分成及物动词和不及物动词
2. 及物动词就是动词后面必须有人 / 物作为宾语来承受这个动作，如此句子的意思才比较完整。而不及物动词本身句子的意思较为完整，所以动词后面不用有人 / 物作为宾语来承受这个动作
3. “have”的后面习惯加上“对象”＝“I have a book.”，这样会比“Ihave.”的语意更加完整
4. “微笑＝smile”本身就可完整传达语意，后面不须特别加上“对象”来当宾语，所以“我微笑着。＝I smile.”就已经是完整的句子。
5. 大部分的动词都兼具“及物动词”和“不及物动词”两种特性，只有极少部分的动词才会只当“及物动词”使用。另外要注意的是，只有名词和代词才可以担任宾语！
6. “like”是“喜欢”的意思，“like”是极少数只能当“及物动词”的动词，也就是说，“like”的后面无论如何都要加上“宾语”来承受“like”这个动作，所以“我喜欢”必须写成“I like it.”才算是正确。
7. I like that blue bus. Do you like that blue bus? Yes, I do/ Yes, I like it. Why do you like that blue bus? I like that blue bus because it is beautiful. I like that garden. Do you like that garden?  Yes, I do/ Yes, I like it.  I like that garden because there are many flowers in that garden.

# 三十四、动词不定式的用法

## 1、 He likes to run in the park.(他喜欢在公园里跑步)

1. 动词不定式＝to＋动词原形（to后面的动词要“打回原形”）
2. 在英文句子里一定要有动词，而且一个句子只能有一个动词！如果这个句子必须有“两个动作”才能完整表达语意的话，那该怎么办呢？例如，“我喜欢跑步”这句里，有“喜欢”和“跑步”两个动作，这时就需要“to”来帮忙，将它放在“喜欢”和“跑步”这两个动词的中间，就可以解决句子中同时存在两个动词的状况，形成“动词1＋to＋动词2”的结构。而其中“to＋动词2”这样的写法，就称作“不定式”
3. “地点”通常要放在句尾。英文句子里，除了有表达过程的“动作”外，通常还要有动作发生时的地点。而英文习惯先“讲完动作”，再说出“地点”，因此地点通常会被放在句尾来叙述
4. I like to walk. I like to walk in that garden. He likes to run. He likes to run in the forest. She likes to swim. She likes to swim in the swimming pool. They like to play. They like to play in my school. John's father likes to teach us English. John's father like to teach us English in his living room. 

## 2、使用“连词and”，就可以允许两个动词同时存在一个句子中！

1. He likes to read and he likes to run. He likes to read and run.
2. He likes to walk and He likes to swim. He likes to walk and swim. I like to sing and I like to drive. I like to  sing and drive. You like to study and you like to work. You like to study and work. Thoes cats like to eat and those cats like to sleep. Those cat like to eat and sleep.

# 三十五、频率副词的用法

## 1、My father is always in his office.(我的父亲（是）总是在他的办公室)

1. 副词：一种“辅助说明”的词
2. 频率副词：跟“事情发生的频率”有关的副词
3. always（总是） often（常常） usually（经常） sometimes（有时） seldom（很少） never（从不）
4. “频率副词”的用法跟中文相似，通常会放在be动词am / are / is的后面，或是实义动词的前面
5. Her house is always dirty. Her piano is often dirty. This young person is usually weak. That postman is sometimes busy. Their parents are seldom merciful. Although that gentleman is rich, he is never lazy. They are usually sad because they are often sick. His daughter always plays in the room. Marry never smiles. My mother seldom drinks in the living room. That teacher usually draws in the office. Your father sometimes swims in the pool. He often teaches me English.

## 2、频率副词里面的usually（通常）和often（常常）两个词通常会混用，不过要细分出两者差异的话，usually（通常）比较常用于“习惯”的表示；而often（常常）比较常用于“次数”的表示，所以还是要根据句子的语意来选择合适的表达。

1. 强调整句时sometimes会放句首
2. That student is sometimes lazy. Sometimes that student is lazy. That teacher sometimes teaches us English. Sometimes that teacher teaches us English.
